                <p>Wastewater treatment plant design is primary process in which untreated wastewater is analyzed and based on requirement of customer/industry & various uses of treated effluent plant is designed. Also design of effluent treatment plan is highly site and industry specific</p>

<p>Design of effluent treatment plant is to treat non-hazardous industrial wastewater and should focus on cost-effective, minimal maintenance and requires minimal manpower etc. Also these plants should include processes such as pH correction, aerated lagoon, polishing/infiltration ponds and sedimentation/facultative basins etc.</p>

<p>Untreated effluent standards and treated effluent standards are also taken into consideration in process of wastewater treatment plant design.</p>
